A Swift package for bit vectors (also called bit arrays).

## Features
 - Compared to one-off single word-oriented Swift implementations, aims to:
   - support arbitrarily-sized bit vectors
   - include full complement of functions
 - Goal is to be performant and memory efficient while still supporting flexible lengths
